# Your-Places-mern
YourPlaces is a social media application designed for sharing your travel experiences with the world. Built using a combination of MongoDB, Express, React, Node, and CSS, this platform enables you to sign up or log in, create posts about the places you've visited, and attach photos. You can also associate the location with a dynamic Google Maps popup, edit your posts, and delete them if needed. The backend seamlessly connects to a MongoDB database, securely storing both user profiles and individual place details.
